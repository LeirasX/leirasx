                <p>Hey, I'm Francisco. Most people call me LX.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I don't do fluff. I'm obsessed with frameworks that actually change behavior. I spent years studying why we do what we do, and more importantly, why we don't do what we say we will.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My work is influenced by the directness of Mark Manson, the simplicity of Derek Sivers, and the precision of Apple's design philosophy. I believe in high-contrast living: work hard, rest deeply. Speak truth, or stay silent.</p>
